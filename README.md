# 📊 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

As I continue exploring the field of data science, this project was all about **understanding data before jumping into modeling**. Using the famous Titanic dataset, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

## 🔍 What I Explored

Here’s what I did as part of my learning:

- 📈 **Summary Statistics**
  - Looked at mean, median, min, max, standard deviation for numerical columns
  - Helped me understand distributions and detect early anomalies

- 📊 **Visual Explorations**
  - **Histograms** to see the spread of features like Age, Fare, etc.
  - **Boxplots** to identify outliers visually
  - **Countplots** to observe survival rates by gender, class, and more

-  **Relationships Between Features**
  - Used a **correlation matrix** and **heatmap** to see how features relate to each other
  - Created a **pairplot** to visually explore multiple variable interactions

-  **Insights and Patterns**
  - Found clear survival differences based on gender and passenger class
  - Identified skewness in Fare distribution
  - Noticed potential multicollinearity in some numeric features

##  Why This Was Important

Before any machine learning model, it’s critical to:
- Understand the shape and quality of your data
- Spot trends that might influence predictions
- Recognize which features might be more powerful or redundant

EDA builds intuition and confidence with the dataset and often leads to smarter modeling choices later on.
